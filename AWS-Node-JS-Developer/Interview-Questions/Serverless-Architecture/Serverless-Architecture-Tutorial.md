# Serverless Architecture Tutorial & Hands-On Practice

## 1. Introduction to Serverless Architecture
Serverless allows you to build and run applications without managing servers. AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3 are common components.

---

## 2. Building a Serverless REST API
- Use API Gateway to create REST endpoints.
- Integrate endpoints with Lambda functions.

---

## 3. Event-Driven Processing
- Trigger Lambda functions from S3, SQS, or DynamoDB events.

---

## 4. Managing State
- Store state externally in databases (e.g., DynamoDB, Aurora) or S3.

---

## 5. Monitoring and Debugging
- Use CloudWatch for logs and metrics.
- Enable X-Ray for distributed tracing.

---

## Practice Exercise
1. Build a REST API using API Gateway and Lambda.
2. Trigger Lambda from S3 object creation.
3. Store and retrieve data from DynamoDB.
4. Monitor your application with CloudWatch.

Try these steps in AWS Console or with the Serverless Framework for hands-on practice!
