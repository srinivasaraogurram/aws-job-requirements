# Advanced GitLab CI/CD Interview Questions

## 1. How do you use cache and artifacts in GitLab CI/CD?
**Answer:**
- Cache is used to speed up jobs by reusing files between pipeline runs.
- Artifacts are files generated by jobs and passed to subsequent jobs.

**Example:**
```yaml
cache:
  paths:
    - node_modules/

artifacts:
  paths:
    - dist/
```

## 2. How do you set up multi-project pipelines in GitLab?
**Answer:**
Use `trigger` and `bridge` jobs to coordinate pipelines across multiple projects.

**Example:**
- Use `trigger` keyword in `.gitlab-ci.yml`

## 3. How do you use conditional job execution?
**Answer:**
Use `rules` and `only/except` to control when jobs run.

**Example:**
```yaml
job:
  script: echo "Run only on master"
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "master"'
```

## 4. How do you secure secrets in GitLab CI/CD?
**Answer:**
Store secrets in GitLab CI/CD environment variables or use HashiCorp Vault integration.

## 5. How do you debug failed pipelines?
**Answer:**
- Use job logs and retry failed jobs
- Add verbose output to scripts
- Use `allow_failure` for non-blocking jobs
