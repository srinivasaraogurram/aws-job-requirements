## What is DataAPI?

**DataAPI** refers to the AWS Data API for Aurora Serverless. It allows you to interact with Aurora Serverless databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL) over HTTPS, without persistent connections or client drivers. You can run SQL statements using HTTP requests, making it ideal for serverless and stateless applications.

- RESTful HTTPS API for Aurora Serverless
- No need for database drivers or connection management
- Authentication via AWS IAM and Secrets Manager
- Commonly used with Lambda, API Gateway, and other AWS services
